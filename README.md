# Targeted Adversarial Attacks in PyTorch
Experimenting with [Targeted Adversarial Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning) on ImageNet models in PyTorch. 

# Model 
Attacks were performed on ResNet34. It was mainly picked as it was a good performer on ImageNet and it was small enough work with locally on an Nvdidia GTX 1070.
